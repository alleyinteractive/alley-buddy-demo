## Get Started

To get started with Buddy:
* Log in to [buddy.works](https://buddy.works).
* Click *Create a new project* at the top.
* Search for your project and select it. Ensure you are selecting the version in the `alleyinteractive` organization.
* Wait for it to sync with GitHub.
* On the right side, click *Pull Requests: OFF* and turn on pull requests. If you don't do this, Buddy will not be able to run against pull requests in your repo.
* When you are done, you should be able to push your branch, create a pull request against the `production` branch, and Buddy should run the configuration in your `.buddy/pull-requests.yml` file automatically. Once this happens and is successful, configure branch protections to require the Buddy task to pass.
